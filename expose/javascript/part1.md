# Part One : Quick Intro
1.  values added : 20
2.  final result : 20
3.  values added : 20
4.  This return refrence error because the result is not defined outside of the block scope.
5.  There will be an error for line 7 because you cannot assign a new value to a constant variable. We tried to reassign the constant by writing the code in line 4 (result = num1 + num2), which will return an error. The console log output "values added: 0" if line 7 did not exist.
6.  This same as the let varible, return a reference error because the result is not defined outside of the block scope.
